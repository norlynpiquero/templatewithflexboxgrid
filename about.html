                    <h2><span class="primary-text">Know</span> Me More</h2>
                    <p>I am a self-taught Web Designer and I am currently learning more about Front-End Web Development/Design online. I can't wait to finish the course and get myself more meaningful projects using the skills I will acquire after finishing the course.</p>
                    <p>While I enjoy learning, I also love to spend some of my time outdoors. I love trekking, reading a book while enjoying a nice cup of coffee, catching up with my friends, just strolling at the beach and meditating. Other topics that I am interested in are Minimalism, Stoicism, Taoism, and Self-Improvement subjects.</p>
                    <p>I strive to be better in what I do and I love how I design my life. I am far from being the best or the most knowledgeable, I embrace my failures and adversities in life. I would like to think that I am an alchemist, who constantly find ways in turning my adversities to my advantage.</p>
                    <p>My favorite quote is Fall Seven, Rise Eight. Whenever I am faced with overwhelming challenges, I remind myself with this Japanese proverb and my life is basically guided by this quote.</p>
                    <p>I hope you enjoyed knowing a little bit about me. Thank you for your time and looking forward to helping you.</p>
